# Compilers
Compiler for C programming language

Created alongside with @zagura for Compilers class. This program succesfully checks syntactic as well as semantic corectness of a given code, as well as interprets it.
Gramatic of C language is slighly different.
Examples of input can be found in tests directory.

Happy using!
